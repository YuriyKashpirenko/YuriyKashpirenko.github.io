              <p>Dual Motor Model S is a categorical improvement on conventional all-wheel drive systems. With two motors, one in the front and one in the rear, Model S digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels. The result is unparalleled traction control in all conditions.</p>
      
              <p>Conventional all-wheel drive cars employ complex mechanical linkages to distribute power from a single engine to all four wheels. Only Tesla has the technology to provide superior and independent traction to both the front and rear wheels by using dual motors.</p>
      
              <p>Model S comes standard with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive, P100D Model S pairs a high performance rear motor with a high efficiency front motor to achieve Ludicrous acceleration, from zero to 100 km/h in 2.7 seconds.</p>

                 Model S is a driver's car. The cabin combines meticulous noise engineering with Tesla's uniquely quiet powertrain to obtain the sound dynamics of a recording studio. The gem of the interior is the 17 inch touchscreen, which is angled toward the driver and includes both day and night modes for better visibility without distraction. It puts rich content at your fingertips and provides mobile connectivity so you can easily find your destination, favorite song or a new restaurant.
