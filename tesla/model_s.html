              <p>Dual Motor Model S is a categorical improvement on conventional all-wheel drive systems. With two motors, one in the front and one in the rear, Model S digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels. The result is unparalleled traction control in all conditions.</p>
      
              <p>Conventional all-wheel drive cars employ complex mechanical linkages to distribute power from a single engine to all four wheels. Only Tesla has the technology to provide superior and independent traction to both the front and rear wheels by using dual motors.</p>
      
              <p>Model S comes standard with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive, P100D Model S pairs a high performance rear motor with a high efficiency front motor to achieve Ludicrous acceleration, from zero to 100 km/h in 2.7 seconds.</p>
